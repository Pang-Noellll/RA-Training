# 2019 AEI RA training

This repository will house resources for AEI RA's to learn how to use GitHub to version control their code and start programming in Python.

## Setting up your computer

### 1. Install Git and create GitHub account

- First, type `git --version` into your terminal window to see if Git is already installed on your computer. If something like `git version 2.23.0` pops up, you're good to go. If not, download Git [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

- Once you have Git installed on your computer, create a GitHub account at [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join).

### 2. Install programming software (Python, R, etc.)

I strongly suggest you download the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). When you download the Anaconda distribution, you will be downloading 1,500+ software packages for R/Python data science. This will make you life much easier down the road when you beginning using multiple software packages in your code because they will already be downloaded.

If you are a Python user, you are good to go. If you are an R user, open your terminal window and type:
```
conda install r-essentials --yes
conda install -c r rstudio --yes
```


### 3. Install a text editor

A text editor is the software you use to write code (in any programming language!). The most popular (and free) text editors are:
- [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
