# 2019 AEI RA training

This repository will house resources for AEI RA's to learn how to use GitHub to version control their code and start programming in Python.

## Setting up your computer

### 1. Install Git and create GitHub account

- First, open your terminal window. On Windows, it's called "Command Prompt" and on Mac, it's called "Terminal." If you're on an AEI computer, make sure the default directory is set to your C drive (as opposed to `H:\...`). To change the default file path, right click the Command Prompt icon in the Start menu and select "Open File Location." Then right click the "Command Prompt" icon, select "Properties," and edit the "Start In" property to `C:\Users\your_name\`.

- Type `git --version` into your terminal window to see if Git is already installed on your computer. If something like `git version 2.23.0` pops up, you're good to go. If not, download Git [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

- Once you have Git installed on your computer, create a GitHub account at [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join).

### 2. Install programming software (Python, R, etc.)

I strongly suggest you download the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). The Anaconda distribution comes with 1,500+ software packages for R/Python data science. This will make your life much easier down the road when you start using multiple software packages in your code because they will already be downloaded.

If you are a Python user, you are good to go. If you are an R user, open your terminal window and type:
```
conda install r-essentials --yes
conda install -c r rstudio --yes
```


### 3. Install a text editor

A text editor is the software you use to write code (in any programming language!). The most popular, and free, text editors are:
- [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/). NOTE: my text editor of choice, but Sublime bugs you to buy a license, which you don't have to do. 
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
